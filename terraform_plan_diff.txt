Terraform will perform the following actions:
​aws_instance.new_server will be created
​resource "aws_instance" "new_server" {
​ami                         = "ami-0abcdef1234567890"
​instance_type               = "t3.medium" # Change from t2.micro
​private_ip                  = (known after apply)
​tags                        = {
​"Environment" = "Prod"
}
​vpc_security_group_ids      = [
​"sg-0444aaaa5555bbbb"
]
​associate_public_ip_address = true # Security Risk
}
​aws_db_instance.db_prod will be updated in-place
​~ resource "aws_db_instance" "db_prod" {
allocated_storage       = 100
~ instance_class          = "db.t3.medium" -> "db.r5.large" # Significant Cost Increase
storage_encrypted       = true
# (25 unchanged attributes hidden)
}
​aws_s3_bucket.logs will be destroyed
​resource "aws_s3_bucket" "logs" {
​acl                         = "private" -> null
​bucket                      = "project-logs-old-2024"
​(13 unchanged attributes hidden)
​}
​Plan: 1 to add, 1 to change, 1 to destroy.
