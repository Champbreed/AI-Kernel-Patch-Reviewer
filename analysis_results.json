        "human_readable_summary": "The patch introduces a conditional check on p->refcount before freeing p->data but removes the assignment that sets p->state to PAGE_FREE. This results in the page object retaining an active state despite its data buffer being released to the allocator. Subsequent kernel operations may attempt to access p->data, leading to a Use-After-Free vulnerability."
